        "Good question !! Here's my 2 cents on emailing professors :\n 1) Email grad students first : They are relatively less busy and will be happy to talk to you about their research.\n 2) Keep it short : Professor's are super super .... super busy and no one has the time to go through a really long email. Instead of talking about yourself, just try summarizing their reseaech in 3-4 lines.\n 3) Do your Homework : Professor's are very interested in knowing about why you are interested in their research over others\n 4) Keep emailing : Chances are you would need to send quite a few emails before you get a reply. So don't give up and keep on following up until you get a clear rejection.",
